# awesome-monocular-3d-detectors
A curated list of dedicated resources to research 3D monocular object detection. Mostly resources is cloned from [**@patrick-llgc** repository](https://github.com/patrick-llgc/Learning-Deep-Learning/blob/master/paper_notes/review_mono_3dod.md).

_Update Notes_
- 04/18/2021: delete title, tl;dr column
- 10/24/2019: initial creation of table
- 10/28/2019: added centerNet (from UT Austin) and mono 3d tracking (from DeepDrive)
- 11/25/2019: blog post published to [towarddatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/monocular-3d-object-detection-in-autonomous-driving-2476a3c7f57e?source=friends_link&sk=160d236be1881b6ee1b431a943666fdb) and google [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X_ViM-W4QbHPbJ2dHouRgkRAyzEnBS6J_9VxPEXvDM4/edit#gid=0).
